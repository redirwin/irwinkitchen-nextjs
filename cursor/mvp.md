Your job is to help me create a personal recipe application tailored for my own and immediate family use, focusing on a minimal viable product (MVP). The app should support user account setup and authentication to allow multiple users to have individual profiles. The primary functionality should include adding and viewing recipes with fields for recipe name, description, ingredients, instructions, cooking time, difficulty level, and serving size. Recipes should be easily categorized and tagged, with the option to attach images. The UI should be clean and simple, making it easy to search, browse, and view recipes based on categories, tags, or ingredients. Ensure that the application is user-friendly, with smooth navigation and clear entry points for adding and managing recipes.

Here's a summary of what we've created:

1. A layout component that provides the overall structure of the application, including navigation.
2. A sign-in component for user authentication.
3. A recipe list component for browsing recipes.
4. A recipe detail component for viewing individual recipes.
5. A recipe form component for adding new recipes.


To complete the MVP, you would need to:

1. Set up the necessary pages in your Next.js application to render these components.
2. Implement the backend API routes for handling data operations (CRUD operations for recipes, user authentication, etc.).
3. Connect the frontend components to the backend API.
4. Set up a database to store the recipe and user data.
5. Implement proper state management (e.g., using React Context or a state management library like Redux).
6. Add image upload functionality for recipe images.
7. Implement search and filtering functionality for recipes.
